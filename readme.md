Hospital Management System:

I need a system to manage my hospital's patients, doctors, and appointments.
Each patient should have a unique patient ID, a name, and a date of birth.
Doctors should have a name, specialization, and years of experience.
The specialization of the doctor can be surgery, internal or pathologist
When a patient books an appointment the system creates it with an ID, a date, and a time.
Create a function that retrieves all patients who have appointments (in the future) with a certain doctor (by doctor specialization).
Get the patient who had the most appointments in the last 30 days.
Get the doctor with the highest experience.
